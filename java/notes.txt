External components needed by the Yosokumo web service client

    To run the client these are needed: 
        Java JVM
        Google protocol buffer jar
        HttpCore, HttpClient, and related jars

    To build and test the client these are needed: 
        Java compiler
        Google protocol buffer compiler
        Javadoc
        JUnit

Following is a log of sorts showing details of the external components, and, 
in particular, what needs to be on the CLASSPATH.

Java

Using the Ubuntu Software Center:  Installed the Sun Java JDK 6.24

    Ubuntu Software Center says:  6.24-1build0.10.04.1 (sun-java6-jdk)

    javac --version says:         javac 1.6.0_24

    java -version says:           java version "1.6.0_20" and more:
        OpenJDK Runtime Environment (IcedTea6 1.9.7) 
            (6b20-1.9.7-0ubuntu1~10.04.1)
        OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 19.0-b09, mixed mode)

Using Synaptic:  Installed JUnit 4

    /usr/share/java/junit4.jar is a link pointing to 
    /usr/share/java/junit4-4.8.1.jar

Also installed junit4-doc, but can't find it anywhere on my system.  Use

    http://kentbeck.github.com/junit/javadoc/latest/

to get to the online Javadoc for JUnit.

Add to CLASSPATH to access JUnit:

    export CLASSPATH=.:/usr/share/java/junit4.jar:$CLASSPATH

At some point in the past, downloaded HttpCore and HttpClient and set up the 
CLASSPATH as follows:

    export CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:/home/roger/OpenSourceCode/HttpClient/httpcomponents-client-4.0.1/lib/httpcore.jar
    export CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:/home/roger/OpenSourceCode/HttpClient/httpcomponents-client-4.0.1/lib/httpclient.jar
    export CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:/home/roger/OpenSourceCode/HttpClient/httpcomponents-client-4.0.1/lib/commons-codec.jar
    export CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:/home/roger/OpenSourceCode/HttpClient/httpcomponents-client-4.0.1/lib/commons-logging.jar

Vague memory:  Read in the past that it is important to use version 4.x rather 
than 3.y, which is what Ubuntu wants to install.

Used Ubuntu Software Center to install Java bindings for Google Protocol 
Buffers:  Version: 2.2.0a-0.1ubuntu1 (libprotobuf-java).  This created the 
following in /usr/share/java

    protobuf-2.2.0.jar
    protobuf.jar (link to the above)

Added to CLASSPATH:

    export CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:/usr/share/java/protobuf.jar

Note that the original install of Ubuntu 10.04 installed the protocol 
compiler:

    /usr/bin/protoc

When this is run with --version, the result is

    libprotoc 2.2..0

Need these in order to use the Yosokumo jar files:

    export CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:/home/roger/yosokumo/java/jar/YosokumoProtobuf.jar
    export CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:/home/roger/yosokumo/java/jar/Yosokumo.jar
